# Browser Emblem
This is a project I originally worked on in 2019/2020 for a webdev class I took that year. I don't remember the specifics of the assignment but I'm pretty sure it was the final project for the course, and of course me being me, I wanted to make a game. Thus, the shitty clone of your favorite dating sim was born, *Browser Emblem*.

Testing the game is pretty simple, just clone/download the repo and open any of the html pages in your browser. `emblem.html` is the actual page where the game is, while `index.html` was our required homepage and `about.html` was essentially the writing section of the project we had to do.
